# Athena Feign Clients

Feign client for Athena

In today's competitive software landscape, ensuring high-quality software is paramount for customer satisfaction, brand
reputation, and overall business success.
To address this imperative, it is a necessity to develop a sophisticated software solution that systematically collects
quality metrics throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
"Athena" aims to collect data to proactively identify and address quality-related issues early in the development
process, thereby reducing costs, improving efficiency, and enhancing overall product quality.

Athena will systematically collect metrics related to software development and application quality at each phase of the
SDLC.
In first phase we tend to build enablement to collect metrics from following sources:

* CI/CD pipeline
* Git repository
* Kubernetes infrastructure
* Task management system (Jira/Zephyr)
* Swagger (OpenApi) documentation

In the future, Athena will analyze data and related metrics to provide realtime insight to code quality, performance,
security, and functional correctness.

# Builds locally

To build Athena locally you need ```maven 3.8.6+```, ```JDK-17```, ```docker``` and ```GitHub authentication```.

## Configure GitHub Authentication

To resolve some of dependencies which are located on github, you should configure authentication information
in ```~/.m2/settings.xml```.

You can either use a GitHub username and password, by adding following configure to your settings.xml:

```xml

<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>github</id>
            <username>your username</username>
            <password>your password</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

Or use the personal access token (PAT) by adding following configure to your settings.xml.

```xml

<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>github</id>
            <password>YOUR OAUTH-TOKEN</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
</settings>
```

## Run tests

Use following command to install and run tests

```shell 
  mvn clean install -U
```
